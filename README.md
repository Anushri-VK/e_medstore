<h1>PROJECT DETAILS</h1>
<p>The main objective of MedsOn is to take whole medical store online so that it is reachable to customers 24/7. The MedsOnline will be a web based system with a very user friendly interface which indeed will make the whole management process easy to manage and operate with zero redundancies. Overall MedsOnline will become an efficient, highly responsive and an extremely accurate system.

The traditional medical store is time consuming, sometimes confusing and requires more man power to operate. Secondly the scope of offline medical store is limited to local area and is available for fixed timing. All the data management involving product availability, searching, billing and other report generation are done manually which indeed are very time consuming. MedsOnline helps people to order their medicines using online web application with a very neat user interface and requires less time.

You will receive a confirmation regarding your orders and appointments on your registered E-mail address.</p>
